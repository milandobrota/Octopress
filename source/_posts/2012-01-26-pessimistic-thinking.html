title: Pessimistic Thinking
---

<blockquote>People who have low opinions of themselves are often extremely harsh on themselves, while they give others the benefit of the doubt. For example, while they freely give compliments to others, or they admire characteristics of others, they unfairly fail to credit themselves for similar actions, or they dismiss themselves as inadequate. When others compliment them, they dismiss these comments as well.</blockquote>&#8212;<a href="http://moodgym.anu.edu.au/" title="Mood Gym" target="_blank">Mood Gym</a>
